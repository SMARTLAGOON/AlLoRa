# T3S3-Tester

This code was developed to test the AlLoRa communication between two T3S3 devices, 
Using the T3S3 screen to display the LoRa communication parameters and the AlLoRa logo.

We define the screen as a subscriber to the Source Node, so it will receive updates on the communication status as the communication advances and show it on the screen.
